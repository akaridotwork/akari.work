    <h3 id=subtitle class="h3A">Hi, I'm Akari! [she/they]</h3>
    <p>
        I'm an 19 years old (semi-closeted) non-binary Vietnamese Software Developer (in training).
        <br>
        I was born and raised in Arnhem and I produce/sing on music
        <br>
        and play video games in my free time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been working with computers since a very young age, from troubleshooting my mom's PC
        <br>
        to installing different VMs to try out new operating systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        I started the "Software Developer" MBO (Dutch version of College) in September 2021 at
        <br>
        Mediacollege Amsterdam college in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm not too experienced yet with coding languages, and this website is one
        <br>
        of my first projects that I'm fully coding myself and in my opinion it looks very cool!
        <br>
        I've made websites in the past and I've always used Wordpress and Elementor,
        <br>
        but they've never been made/coded using html + css only.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        If you want to see what I do in my free time, go check my "Current Projects"!
